# SEO Content Types and Common Mistakes

## Format Guidance by Content Type

Choose the content format based on search intent analysis and SERP format dominance. Each content type has structural patterns that search engines expect.

| Type | Length | Structure | Keyword Pattern |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pillar page | 2,500-5,000 words | Deep coverage, many H2/H3, heavy internal links | Broad head term |
| How-to / tutorial | 1,500-3,000 words | Numbered steps, prerequisites, troubleshooting | "how to [verb] [noun]" |
| Comparison | 1,500-2,500 words | Comparison table + analysis per option | "[X] vs [Y]", "best [category]" |
| FAQ / knowledge base | 1,000-2,000 words | Questions as headings, concise answers | "what is", "how does", "why" |
| Case study | 1,000-2,500 words | Situation-Challenge-Solution-Results | "[solution] case study" |

### Pillar Page

A pillar page is the definitive resource for a broad topic. It covers every major subtopic at sufficient depth and links to more detailed pages on each subtopic.

**Structure pattern:**
- H1: Broad topic keyword
- H2: Each major subtopic (8-15 sections)
- H3: Sub-points within complex subtopics
- Internal links to cluster pages for each subtopic
- Table of contents at the top

**Keyword strategy:** Target a competitive head term (e.g., "OAuth 2.0") and use the pillar page to build topical authority. Secondary keywords go to cluster pages that link back.

### How-To / Tutorial

A how-to page walks the reader through a process. It targets informational and transactional intent from searchers who need to accomplish a specific task.

**Structure pattern:**
- H1: "How to [Verb] [Noun]" with primary keyword
- Brief intro: What this tutorial covers and who it is for
- Prerequisites section (if applicable)
- Numbered steps as H2 headings or an ordered list
- Troubleshooting section for common problems
- Summary or next steps

**Keyword strategy:** Target long-tail "how to" phrases. These have clear intent and high conversion to engagement because the reader needs to complete a task.

### Comparison

A comparison page helps the reader evaluate options. It targets commercial intent from searchers who are deciding between alternatives.

**Structure pattern:**
- H1: "[X] vs [Y]" or "Best [Category] in [Year]"
- Overview comparison table near the top
- H2: Dedicated section for each option
- H2: Direct comparison on key criteria
- H2: Recommendation by use case ("Choose X if... Choose Y if...")

**Keyword strategy:** Target "[X] vs [Y]" and "best [category]" queries. Include both option names in headings. The comparison table targets table snippets.

### FAQ / Knowledge Base

FAQ content answers specific questions directly. It targets informational intent and is structured to win featured snippets and PAA boxes.

**Structure pattern:**
- H1: Topic overview keyword
- H2: Each question, phrased as searchers ask it
- Answer immediately follows each H2 (40-60 words for snippet targeting, then expanded detail)
- Questions ordered from most fundamental to most advanced

**Keyword strategy:** Target question-based queries ("what is," "how does," "why"). Use exact question phrasing in H2 headings to maximize snippet eligibility.

### Case Study

A case study demonstrates results through a specific example. It targets commercial intent and builds E-E-A-T through demonstrated experience.

**Structure pattern:**
- H1: "[Solution] Case Study: [Result or Company]"
- H2: The Situation (context and starting conditions)
- H2: The Challenge (specific problem to solve)
- H2: The Solution (what was implemented and why)
- H2: The Results (quantified outcomes)
- H2: Key Takeaways

**Keyword strategy:** Target "[solution] case study" and "[solution] results" queries. Include specific numbers in headings when possible.

## Common SEO Writing Mistakes

These mistakes are frequent in AI-assisted content and will hurt both rankings and reader trust.

| Mistake | Why It Hurts | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| "In today's digital landscape..." | Signals generic AI content to readers and reviewers. Google's helpful content system penalizes generic, mass-produced text. | Start with a specific claim, statistic, or concrete scenario that demonstrates expertise. |
| Keyword in every paragraph | Unnatural density triggers spam signals. Readers notice and lose trust. Search engines detect over-optimization. | Use semantic variations and related terms. The primary keyword should appear 3-5 times in a 2,000-word piece, not 20 times. |
| Headers like "Introduction" | Wastes heading real estate on a word with zero search value. Provides no navigation signal to readers or crawlers. | Make every heading specific and keyword-aware. Replace "Introduction" with a heading that states the section's actual topic. |
| Thin sections (1-2 sentences) | Signals incomplete coverage. Search engines interpret thin sections as a sign the content is not genuinely helpful. | Merge thin sections with related content or expand with evidence, examples, or practical detail. Minimum 3-4 sentences per section. |
| No original perspective | Provides no ranking advantage over existing content. Google's helpful content system rewards content with unique value. | Add first-hand experience, unique data, contrarian analysis, or practical examples that competitors do not have. |
| Writing for engines not readers | High bounce rate and low engagement signals. Users who arrive and immediately leave tell search engines the content did not satisfy intent. | Write for the reader first, then optimize for search. If a sentence feels awkward because of a keyword, rewrite it for readability. |

### Additional Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Orphan content:** Pages with no internal links pointing to them. Search engines discover and value pages partly through internal link structure. Every page should have at least 2-3 internal links from other pages.

**Duplicate title tags:** Multiple pages with the same title tag compete against each other. Every page needs a unique title tag targeting a distinct keyword.

**Missing alt text on images:** Images without alt text are invisible to search engines. Write alt text that describes the image content and includes a relevant keyword when natural.

**Ignoring page speed:** Content quality is irrelevant if the page loads slowly. Large uncompressed images, render-blocking scripts, and excessive third-party requests harm both rankings and user experience.

**Neglecting mobile structure:** Over 60% of searches happen on mobile devices. Content must be readable on small screens: short paragraphs, adequate font size, tappable links, and no horizontal scrolling.
