# Search Intent Analysis

## The Four Search Intents

Every search query falls into one of four intent categories. Matching your content format to the correct intent is the single most important SEO decision. A perfectly optimized page targeting the wrong intent will not rank.

| Intent | Searcher Wants | Content Format | Example Query |
|---|---|---|---|
| Informational | Learn or understand | Guide, explainer, tutorial | "what is OAuth 2.0" |
| Navigational | Find a specific page | Landing page, docs | "Stripe API documentation" |
| Commercial | Compare before deciding | Comparison, review, list | "best CI/CD tools 2026" |
| Transactional | Take action | Product page, CTA-driven | "buy SSL certificate" |

### Identifying Intent from a Query

**Informational signals:** "what is," "how to," "why does," "guide to," "explained." The searcher wants to learn. They are not ready to buy or compare.

**Navigational signals:** Brand names, product names, specific page references. The searcher knows where they want to go and is using Google as a shortcut.

**Commercial signals:** "best," "vs," "review," "comparison," "top," "alternatives." The searcher is evaluating options. They want structured comparison, not a sales pitch.

**Transactional signals:** "buy," "pricing," "discount," "sign up," "download," "free trial." The searcher is ready to act. They want a clear path to conversion.

### Mixed Intent Queries

Some queries blend intents. "best project management tool" is commercial (comparing options) with a transactional undertone (the searcher will eventually buy). In these cases, lead with the dominant intent and layer in the secondary.

## SERP Analysis Checklist

Before writing or structuring any content, analyze the current search results for your target query. The SERP tells you what Google already considers a good answer.

### 1. Content Format Dominance

What format dominates the top 10 results? If 8 of 10 results are listicles, writing a narrative essay is fighting the format. Match the dominant format or have a compelling reason to deviate.

Formats to check for:
- Long-form guides (2,000+ words)
- Listicles ("10 best..." / "7 ways to...")
- Tutorials with steps
- Comparison tables
- Product pages
- Video results
- Tool/calculator pages

### 2. Average Word Count

Estimate the word count of the top 3-5 ranking pages. This gives you a floor, not a ceiling. Your content should be at least as comprehensive as what already ranks, but longer is not automatically better. Depth and usefulness beat length.

### 3. Table-Stakes Subtopics

Identify subtopics that appear in most top-ranking pages. These are table stakes -- your content must cover them to be considered comprehensive. If every top result covers "security considerations" and yours does not, you have a coverage gap.

### 4. Opportunity Gaps

Identify subtopics, angles, or depth levels that NO top-ranking page covers well. These are your differentiation opportunities. A gap might be:
- A subtopic mentioned but not explained
- An outdated section in competitor content
- A missing use case or audience segment
- An absence of original data, examples, or experience

### 5. Featured Snippet Analysis

Check if a featured snippet appears for the query. If it does:
- What format is it? (paragraph, list, table)
- Which page owns it?
- Can you provide a better answer in the same format?

If no featured snippet exists, there is an opportunity to claim one. Structure your content to trigger snippet selection.

### 6. People Also Ask (PAA)

Record the People Also Ask questions that appear. These are direct signals of related queries searchers care about. Each PAA question is a candidate for:
- An H2 heading in your content
- A FAQ section
- A standalone content piece if the topic is deep enough

### 7. Reading Level

Assess the reading level of top-ranking content. If competitors write at a 9th-grade level, writing at a graduate level may hurt engagement. Match or slightly simplify the reading level of successful content for your audience.

## Using the Analysis

After completing the SERP analysis checklist, you should have clear answers to:

1. **What format should this content take?** (Matches dominant format or fills a gap)
2. **How long should it be?** (Meets the comprehensiveness floor)
3. **What must it cover?** (Table-stakes subtopics)
4. **How will it differentiate?** (Opportunity gaps)
5. **Are there snippet opportunities?** (Format and targeting plan)
6. **What related questions should it answer?** (PAA integration)
7. **What reading level should it target?** (Audience-appropriate complexity)

Feed these answers into the Architect phase. They inform heading structure, section planning, and content depth decisions.
