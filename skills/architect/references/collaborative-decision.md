# Collaborative Decision Process

The Architect phase is where the human-AI collaboration model shifts. In the Madman phase, AI leads generation while the human seeds. In the Architect phase, this inverts: the human leads strategic decisions while the AI formulates and presents options.

This reference defines that decision process.

## Why Human Leads Here

The Architect phase is fundamentally about editorial intent. What is this piece about? Who is it for? What makes it worth reading? These are judgment calls that depend on context AI does not have:

- The writer's relationship with the audience
- Organizational priorities and positioning
- What the writer actually believes and is willing to defend
- Which arguments the writer can credibly make from experience
- Strategic timing and competitive considerations

AI can organize material, identify patterns, propose structures, and spot gaps. It cannot decide what the piece should mean. That decision belongs to the human.

## The Decision Points

Three decisions require explicit human sign-off during the Architect phase. Do not proceed past any of these without confirmation.

### Decision 1: The Throughline

AI presents 2-3 candidate throughlines derived from the strongest Madman material. Each candidate includes:

- The throughline sentence itself
- Which starred material supports it
- What angle or audience it implies
- What gets cut if this throughline is chosen

The human selects one, modifies one, or rejects all and provides direction for a new set. AI does not choose the throughline by default. If the human says "you pick," push back once: "The throughline determines what 70% of the material gets cut. Which of these directions matches your intent?" If the human insists, select the one with the strongest evidentiary support and flag that it was AI-selected.

### Decision 2: The Structure

After the throughline is locked, AI proposes 1-2 structure options using the templates from `blueprint-template.md`. Each proposal includes:

- The template type (technical, SEO, tutorial) and why it fits
- A section-by-section outline showing where material maps
- Identified gaps and what filling them would require
- Estimated scope (word count range, section count)

The human selects, modifies, or requests alternatives. Common modification patterns:
- Merging two proposed sections into one
- Reordering sections for a different narrative flow
- Adding a section AI did not propose
- Cutting a section AI included

All of these are valid editorial decisions. Implement them without argument unless they create a structural problem (a counterargument section before the thesis is stated, for example). If they do, explain the structural issue and let the human decide.

### Decision 3: Blueprint Approval

The complete Architect Blueprint is presented for final review. The human can:

- **Approve** -- The blueprint becomes the Carpenter's spec. Proceed.
- **Approve with notes** -- Minor adjustments that do not change the structure. Make the changes and proceed.
- **Request revision** -- Structural changes needed. Revise the blueprint and present again.
- **Restart** -- The throughline or structure is fundamentally wrong. Return to Decision 1 or Decision 2.

## Presenting Options Effectively

When presenting choices to the human, follow these principles:

**Frame as trade-offs, not rankings.** Do not present Option A as clearly better than Option B. If one option were obviously superior, there would be no decision to make. Instead, show what each option optimizes for and what it sacrifices.

**Keep to 2-3 options.** One option is not a choice. Four or more creates decision fatigue. Two options work when the trade-off is clear. Three options work when there is a meaningful middle ground or a genuinely different angle.

**Make options meaningfully different.** Three variations on the same structure waste the human's time. Each option should represent a different editorial strategy: different audience, different argument, different emphasis.

**Include the "what gets cut" for each option.** The cost of a structural choice is as important as the benefit. Showing what material does not survive each option helps the human make an informed decision.

## Handoff to Carpenter

The approved blueprint is the Carpenter's spec. This handoff is a formal boundary.

### What the Carpenter Receives

- The finalized Architect Blueprint with all sections, key points, evidence, and transitions
- The throughline sentence
- The target audience definition
- The gap list (what needs to be written fresh vs. adapted from Madman material)
- SEO notes if applicable

### What the Carpenter Does NOT Do

- Change the section order
- Add new sections not in the blueprint
- Cut sections from the blueprint
- Redefine the throughline
- Change the target audience

The Carpenter builds. It executes the blueprint faithfully, focusing on prose quality, transitions, voice, and craft. Structural decisions are done.

### When Structure Breaks During Construction

Sometimes the Carpenter discovers that a structural decision does not work in practice. A transition between two sections is impossible. A section does not have enough material to stand alone. Two sections turn out to be the same argument stated differently.

When this happens, the correct response is to send the problem back to the Architect phase. Do NOT redesign the structure during construction. The process is:

1. The Carpenter identifies the structural problem and describes it specifically
2. The problem is brought to the human's attention
3. The Architect phase reopens for the affected sections only
4. A revised blueprint section is approved
5. The Carpenter resumes construction with the updated spec

This may feel slower than "just fixing it during writing." It is not. Structural problems discovered during construction and patched on the fly produce inconsistent pieces where the first half follows one logic and the second half follows another. Returning to the Architect phase keeps the structure coherent.

## Anti-Patterns

### AI Picks the Throughline by Default

The AI should never silently choose the throughline. Even if the human has not explicitly stated a preference, present options and ask. The throughline is the single most consequential decision in the piece.

### Skipping Triage and Going Straight to Structure

Without triage, the structure tries to accommodate everything the Madman produced. This creates bloated, unfocused outlines where weak material gets its own section. Triage first, structure second.

### Approval as Rubber Stamp

If the human approves instantly without engaging with the blueprint, consider whether the blueprint was presented at the right level of detail. A good blueprint should prompt at least one question or adjustment. If it does not, the human may be skimming rather than evaluating.

### Redesigning During Carpenter Phase

When the Carpenter finds a problem, the temptation is to fix it in place. This produces structural drift -- the built piece diverges from the approved blueprint, and nobody has a clear picture of the actual structure. Send it back. The round-trip is worth the coherence.
