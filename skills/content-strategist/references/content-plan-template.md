# Content Plan Template

This reference provides the full content plan format used by the content-strategist skill.

## Full Content Plan Format

```markdown
# Content Plan: [Domain]

## Domain Summary
[2-3 sentences describing the knowledge domain and the strategic intent behind this content initiative]

## Domain Whirlybird (Selected)

\```mermaid

  root((Domain Center))
    Branch One
      Feather 1a
      Feather 1b
    Branch Two
      Feather 2a
      Feather 2b
      Feather 2c
    Branch Three
      Feather 3a
      Feather 3b
\```

## Content Topology: [Pillar + Clusters / Standalone / Hybrid]

**Rationale:** [Why this topology fits the domain and the human's goals]

---

## Pillar Article

**Working title:** [title]
**Center of gravity:** [from whirlybird center]
**Branches covered:** [all / selected -- list which]
**Target length:** [word count]
**Primary keyword:** [if SEO applies, otherwise omit]
**Secondary keywords:** [if SEO applies]
**Purpose:** [what this article accomplishes for the reader]
**Cross-links to:** [list of cluster articles it will link to]

---

## Cluster Articles

### Cluster 1: [Working Title]

**Source:** Branch [N] -- [branch label]
**Focus:** [specific angle this article takes on the branch]
**Target length:** [word count]
**Primary keyword:** [if SEO]
**Links to pillar:** [how it connects -- specific section or concept]
**Links to other clusters:** [cross-linking opportunities]
**Key feathers to cover:**
- [Feather N.1]: [what this feather becomes in the article]
- [Feather N.2]: [what this feather becomes in the article]

### Cluster 2: [Working Title]

**Source:** Branch [N] -- [branch label]
**Focus:** [specific angle]
**Target length:** [word count]
**Primary keyword:** [if SEO]
**Links to pillar:** [connection point]
**Links to other clusters:** [cross-linking opportunities]
**Key feathers to cover:**
- [Feather N.1]: [mapping]
- [Feather N.2]: [mapping]

[Repeat for each cluster article]

---

## Targeted Pieces

### Targeted 1: [Working Title]

**Source:** Feather [N.N] -- [feather label]
**Focus:** [specific question this piece answers]
**Target length:** [word count]
**Primary keyword:** [if SEO, likely a long-tail keyword]
**Links to:** [which cluster or pillar this connects to]
**Justification:** [why this feather warrants its own piece rather than a section in the cluster]

[Repeat for each targeted piece]

---

## Production Order

The production order determines which articles are written first. The order is strategic, not arbitrary.

1. **Pillar article** -- Write first. The pillar establishes the domain framework that all other pieces reference. Writing the pillar first forces clarity on the overall argument and creates the linking structure for clusters.

2. **[Cluster title]** -- Highest-value cluster. [Why this cluster comes second -- highest search volume, strongest material, most urgent topic, or dependency for other clusters.]

3. **[Cluster title]** -- [Rationale for this position in the order.]

4. **[Cluster title]** -- [Rationale.]

5. **Targeted pieces as needed** -- Targeted pieces can be written in any order after their parent cluster is complete. They fill gaps, target long-tail keywords, or address specific reader questions.

### Production Order Rationale

| Position | Article | Reason |
|----------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Pillar | Establishes framework and linking structure |
| 2 | [Cluster] | [Specific reason] |
| 3 | [Cluster] | [Specific reason] |
| N | Targeted pieces | Fill gaps after parent cluster exists |

---

## Cross-Linking Strategy

### Internal Links

| From | To | Link Context |
|------|----|-------------|
| Pillar, Section [N] | Cluster [A] | "For a deeper dive into [topic], see [link]" |
| Cluster [A], Section [N] | Pillar | "This is part of our [domain] series. See the overview: [link]" |
| Cluster [A], Section [N] | Cluster [B] | "[Topic from B] directly affects [topic from A]. See [link]" |
| Targeted [1] | Cluster [A] | "For broader context on [branch topic], see [link]" |

### Linking Principles

- Every cluster links back to the pillar at least once
- The pillar links forward to every cluster
- Clusters cross-link when they share concepts or dependencies
- Targeted pieces link to their parent cluster
- Links are contextual (embedded in relevant text), not footer lists

---

## Shared Research Corpus

All articles draw from the same research corpus established during research-intake.

**Corpus location:** [path to research materials]
**Knowledge map:** [path or reference to the knowledge map]
**Gap-fill notes:** [paths to any notes created during gap analysis]

When entering the Madman phase for any article in this plan, begin with the relevant subset of the shared corpus rather than starting research from scratch.

---

## Notes and Constraints

[Any additional context: publication timelines, SEO targets, audience considerations, format requirements, or constraints the human has specified]
```

---

## Adapting the Template

### No SEO

When the content strategy is not SEO-driven, omit all keyword fields. Replace them with audience-centric fields:

- **Reader question addressed:** [what question this piece answers]
- **Reader transformation:** [what changes for the reader after reading]

### Single Pillar (No Clusters)

When the topology is a single pillar article, the content plan simplifies to just the Pillar Article section plus Production Order. Omit Cluster Articles and Targeted Pieces sections.

### Standalone Articles (No Pillar)

When the topology is multiple standalone articles, replace the Pillar Article section with a **Series Overview** section that describes how the articles relate without a hub page. Each article gets its own entry similar to the Cluster format.
