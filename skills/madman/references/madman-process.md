# Madman Generation Process

This reference details the step-by-step generation process for the Madman phase, including the dimension checklist, phase rules, and output format.

## Phase 1 Rules

These rules are non-negotiable during Madman generation. Violating any of them collapses the creative space.

1. **No self-censoring.** Every idea gets written down, even the ones that feel stupid, obvious, or wrong. The filter comes later.
2. **No organizing.** Do not sort ideas into categories as you generate them. Dump everything in sequence. Structure is the Architect's job.
3. **No polishing.** Do not rewrite sentences for clarity or style. Rough is fine. Messy is fine. Energy matters more than elegance.
4. **Overproduce deliberately.** The goal is 3-5x the material the final piece will use. If the final piece is 2,000 words, generate 6,000-10,000 words of raw material.
5. **Capture energy.** When a passage comes out with momentum, mark it. These high-energy fragments often survive all the way to the final draft even when everything around them changes.

## The Dimension Checklist

Work through each dimension in sequence. Not every dimension will yield material for every topic, but every dimension must be attempted.

### 1. Core Arguments

Generate the strongest thesis candidates for this piece. Write each as a single declarative sentence. Aim for 5-10 candidates that take different positions or emphasize different aspects of the topic.

Do not pick a winner. Generate all plausible positions.

### 2. Evidence, Data, and Examples

For each core argument, brainstorm supporting evidence:
- Published data, statistics, or research findings
- Named case studies or real-world examples
- Historical precedents or analogies
- Expert quotes or authoritative sources
- Personal experience from the human's seed

Flag any claims that need verification. Do not fabricate statistics.

### 3. Audience Questions

Write out every question the target reader is likely to ask:
- What they want to know before they start reading
- What objections they will raise mid-article
- What they will want to do after reading
- What assumptions they bring that the piece needs to address

### 4. Unique Angles

Push beyond the obvious framing:
- What would a contrarian say about this topic?
- What adjacent field has a useful analogy?
- What is everyone in this space getting wrong?
- What is the second-order consequence nobody talks about?
- What would make this piece different from the top 10 existing articles?

### 5. Hooks and Openers

Write 3-5 complete opening paragraphs, each using a different hook strategy:

| Strategy | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Provocative claim | Lead with a bold, debatable statement |
| Story or scene | Open with a specific moment or character |
| Question | Pose the central question the piece answers |
| Data point | Lead with a surprising statistic or finding |
| Contradiction | Present two truths that seem to conflict |

Each hook should be a full paragraph, not a one-liner. Write enough to feel the energy of each approach.

### 6. Raw Fragments

Capture any passage that emerges with force during generation. These are not polished paragraphs -- they are raw bursts of writing where the voice, argument, or insight came through clearly.

Mark each fragment with a brief note about where it might fit (opening, middle, closing, sidebar) but do not organize them further.

### 7. Counterarguments

List every reasonable objection to the core arguments:
- What a skeptic would say
- What evidence cuts against the thesis
- What edge cases break the argument
- What the strongest opposing position looks like

These counterarguments become the raw material for the piece's credibility and nuance.

### 8. Analogies and Metaphors

Generate concrete comparisons:
- What is this topic like in another domain?
- What physical metaphor captures the core dynamic?
- What everyday experience mirrors this abstract concept?

Bad analogies are fine at this stage. Generate volume, not precision.

### 9. Real-World Applications

For each core argument, describe a concrete scenario:
- How does this apply to the reader's daily work?
- What would change if the reader adopted this idea?
- What does success look like in practice?
- What does failure look like?

### 10. Connections to Adjacent Topics

Map the edges of the topic:
- What related subjects does this touch?
- What larger trend does this fit into?
- What prerequisite knowledge does the reader need?
- What follow-up topics does this piece naturally lead to?

## SEO Content: Additional Dimensions

When the content type is SEO-focused, add these dimensions after completing the standard checklist:

### Keyword Variations

- Primary keyword and close synonyms
- Long-tail variations (3-5 word phrases)
- Related terms that indicate the same search intent
- Semantic cluster words that search engines associate with the topic

### PAA-Style Questions

Generate 10-15 "People Also Ask" style questions:
- Questions that start with "What," "How," "Why," "When," "Is," "Can," "Does"
- Questions at different knowledge levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
- Questions that reveal adjacent intent

### Angle Gaps

Review the top-ranking content for the target keyword and identify:
- What perspectives are missing from existing content?
- What depth is missing?
- What formats are missing (tables, comparisons, step-by-step)?
- What audience segments are underserved?

### Featured Snippet Targets

For each major section of the eventual piece, draft:
- A concise definition (40-60 words) that could win a definition snippet
- A numbered list (3-8 items) that could win a list snippet
- A comparison table that could win a table snippet

## Raw Ideas Output Format

Use this template for all Madman output. Every section must be populated. If a dimension yielded nothing, write "None generated -- revisit after human review" rather than omitting it.

```markdown
# Madman Output: [Topic]

**Seed:** [Summary of human-provided seed]
**Audience:** [Target reader]
**Angle:** [Core angle or thesis direction]
**Target length:** [Expected final word count]
**Content type:** [Article, tutorial, white paper, etc.]

## Core Ideas
1. [Thesis candidate]
2. [Thesis candidate]
...

## Evidence & Examples
- [Data point or example, with source if known]

- [Objection the reader will raise]
...

## Unique Angles
- [Contrarian take or surprising framing]
- [Connection to unexpected domain]
...

## Hooks & Openers

### Hook 1: [Strategy name]
[Full opening paragraph]

### Hook 2: [Strategy name]
[Full opening paragraph]

### Hook 3: [Strategy name]
[Full opening paragraph]

## Raw Fragments
> [Fragment with energy] -- [note on potential placement]

> [Fragment with energy] -- [note on potential placement]

## Counterarguments

## Completion Check

Before delivering Madman output, verify:

- [ ] All 10 dimensions attempted (or explicitly marked as not applicable)
- [ ] At least 3 hook candidates written as full paragraphs
- [ ] Raw material volume is 3-5x the target final length
- [ ] No organizing or structuring has crept in
- [ ] High-energy fragments are marked
- [ ] Human's seed angle is reflected in the material, not overwritten
- [ ] Counterarguments are included, not just supporting evidence
