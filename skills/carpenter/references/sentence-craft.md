# Sentence Craft Reference

This reference covers sentence-level writing technique for the Carpenter phase. These are construction fundamentals, not stylistic preferences. Apply them consistently.

## Vary Sentence Length

Monotonous sentence length puts readers to sleep. Mix short declarative sentences with longer explanatory ones. Short sentences punch. Long sentences develop ideas, connect concepts, and carry the reader through complex reasoning. The contrast between them creates rhythm.

A paragraph of all short sentences feels choppy and breathless. A paragraph of all long sentences feels dense and exhausting. Alternate deliberately.

**Rule of thumb:** If three consecutive sentences are the same length, rewrite one.

## Lead with the Point

State the point first. Then explain, support, and qualify. Readers scan. If the point is buried in the middle or end of a paragraph, scanners miss it and careful readers waste effort finding it.

**Point-first:** "Active voice makes prose clearer. The subject acts on the object, which gives the reader a direct line from actor to action to result."

**Buried lede:** "When we consider the various ways that sentences can be constructed, and we look at the relationship between subject and object, we find that active voice, where the subject acts on the object, tends to produce clearer prose."

The second version makes the reader work to find the point. The first version delivers it immediately and then explains why.

## Use Concrete Language

Abstract language obscures meaning. Concrete language reveals it. Replace vague terms with specific ones whenever possible.

**Abstract:** "The system experienced degraded performance under high utilization conditions."

**Concrete:** "Response times doubled when the server hit 80% CPU usage."

The concrete version tells the reader exactly what happened. The abstract version tells them something happened but leaves the details unclear.

Concrete language also builds credibility. Specifics signal that the writer knows the subject. Abstractions signal that the writer might be guessing.

## Prefer Active Voice

Active voice puts the actor before the action. Passive voice puts the action before the actor or hides the actor entirely.

**Active:** "The function validates the input before processing it."

**Passive:** "The input is validated before being processed."

Use active voice as the default. It is shorter, clearer, and more direct. Switch to passive voice only when the action matters more than the actor, or when the actor is unknown or irrelevant.

**Justified passive:** "The vulnerability was discovered in 2019." (Who discovered it is less important than when.)

**Unjustified passive:** "The configuration file is read by the application at startup." (The actor matters here. Write: "The application reads the configuration file at startup.")

## One Idea per Paragraph

Each paragraph should make one point. If you find a paragraph making two distinct points, split it into two paragraphs. The topic sentence states the point. The remaining sentences support it. When the support is complete, start a new paragraph for the next point.

Long paragraphs are not inherently bad. A paragraph can be long if every sentence supports the same point. But a paragraph that wanders between multiple ideas confuses the reader about what the paragraph is actually arguing.

**Test:** Can you summarize the paragraph in one sentence? If you need two sentences, it is probably two paragraphs.

## Transitions and Flow

Good transitions make the reader forget they are reading sections. The content simply flows from one idea to the next.

**Logical connection over transition words.** If the ideas connect logically, the transition is often implicit. Do not force transition words ("However," "Furthermore," "Additionally") where the logic already carries. Use them when the relationship between ideas is genuinely surprising or when the direction shifts.

**End of section creates pull.** The last sentence of a section should make the reader want to read the next section. It can do this by raising a question, identifying a consequence, or previewing what comes next. It should not do this by saying "In the next section, we will discuss..."

**Paragraph-level flow.** Within a section, each paragraph should follow naturally from the previous one. If you have to force a transition between paragraphs, the order might be wrong. Try rearranging before adding transition language.

## Anti-Patterns

These are the most common sentence-level problems. Recognizing them is the first step to avoiding them.

**Wall of text.** Long, unbroken paragraphs with no visual breaks. Readers skip them. Split into shorter paragraphs. Use headings and lists when the content supports them.

**Buried lede.** The main point appears in the middle or end of the paragraph instead of the beginning. Restructure so the point comes first.

**Abstract language.** Vague terms that could mean anything. Replace with specific, concrete language. If you cannot make it concrete, you may not understand the subject well enough to write about it yet.

**Passive voice overuse.** Occasional passive voice is fine. Consistent passive voice makes prose feel evasive and bureaucratic. If more than one in four sentences uses passive voice, revise.

**Monotonous sentence length.** Every sentence the same length creates a drone. Vary deliberately. Follow a long sentence with a short one. Or vice versa.
