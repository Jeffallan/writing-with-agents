# Carpenter Construction Process

This reference defines the section-by-section construction method, the quality checklist, and the phase rules that govern the Carpenter's work.

## Section-by-Section Construction

Work through the blueprint in strict order. Each section follows the same construction pattern.

### Opening: Topic Sentence

Open every section with a clear topic sentence that states the section's main point. The reader should know what the section is about after the first sentence. Do not open with background, context, or throat-clearing. State the point, then support it.

**Strong opening:** "Caching reduces database load by serving repeated queries from memory."

**Weak opening:** "When we think about performance, there are many factors to consider, and one of them is how we handle repeated requests."

### Middle: Evidence and Support

After the topic sentence, support the claim with evidence, examples, or data drawn from the blueprint. The blueprint specifies what source material belongs in each section. Use it.

- Present evidence in order of strength. Lead with the most compelling point.
- Use concrete examples immediately after abstract claims.
- If the blueprint assigns data or statistics to a section, integrate them naturally into the prose rather than listing them.
- Keep paragraphs focused. One idea per paragraph. If a paragraph makes two points, split it.

### Closing: Transition

Close every section with a sentence that connects its content to the next section. The transition should feel natural, not mechanical. The end of one section should make the reader want to continue to the next.

**Natural transition:** "With the data model in place, the next decision is how the API exposes it."

**Mechanical transition:** "Now we will discuss the API layer."

## Maintaining Voice and Tone

Consistency matters more than perfection. Choose a voice at the start and hold it throughout.

- Match the voice to the audience specified in the blueprint.
- If the blueprint does not specify voice, default to clear, direct, and professional.
- Avoid shifting between formal and casual within the same piece.
- Read the draft aloud (or simulate reading aloud) to catch tonal shifts.

## Carpenter Quality Checklist

Run this checklist against the complete draft before handoff. Every item must pass.

- [ ] Every section follows the blueprint structure and order
- [ ] Every paragraph has a clear topic sentence
- [ ] Every claim has supporting evidence or a concrete example
- [ ] Transitions between sections are smooth and logical
- [ ] Voice and tone are consistent from start to finish
- [ ] Technical terms are defined on first use
- [ ] The piece can be read start-to-finish without confusion
- [ ] The opening hook is compelling and draws the reader in
- [ ] The conclusion synthesizes the argument rather than merely summarizing the sections

If any item fails, fix it before delivering the draft.

## Phase Rules

These rules define what the Carpenter does and does not do. They protect the integrity of the multi-phase writing process.

**Follow the blueprint.** The Architect's structure is the contract. The Carpenter executes it. If a section feels wrong or out of order, flag it for the human rather than rearranging on your own. Structural changes require going back to the Architect phase.

**Write, do not edit.** The Carpenter's job is construction, not decoration. Write clear, solid prose. Do not spend time on stylistic flourishes, word-level polish, or rhythm optimization. That work belongs to the Judge phase. A well-framed wall does not need to be beautiful. It needs to be plumb and square.

**Build the whole house before decorating.** Complete every section in the blueprint before returning to revise any section. Forward momentum matters. A half-built draft with one polished section is worse than a complete draft with rough edges. The Judge will smooth those edges.

**Leave polish for the Judge.** Resist the temptation to line-edit as you draft. If you notice an awkward sentence, leave it and keep building. Mark it if you must, but do not stop construction to fix it. The Judge phase exists precisely for this work.
