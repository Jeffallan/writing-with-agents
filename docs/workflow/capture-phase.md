# Capture Phase

The capture phase provides a standalone utility for building a research corpus one source at a time.

**Command:** `/writing-with-agents:capture <path> <source>`

Captures content from a URL, file path, or raw text and produces a structured Flowers research-source note with full frontmatter and standardized body sections.

Use this command independently or as part of the content strategy workflow's intake phase.
