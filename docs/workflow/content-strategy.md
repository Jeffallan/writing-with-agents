# Content Strategy Workflow

Orchestrates multi-article content production from a research corpus:

1. **Research Intake** — Ingest source material, build knowledge map
2. **Gap Analysis** — Identify and fill research gaps with human steering
3. **Domain Mapping** — Generate domain whirlybird, identify content topology
4. **Content Plan** — Plan pillar, cluster, and targeted articles with production order
5. **Production** — Execute Flowers cycle for each article
6. **Knowledge Harvest** — Capture research artifacts back to vault

The outer loop runs once per domain. The inner loop (Flowers cycle) runs once per article.
