# Writing Phase

The writing phase contains two workflows:

1. **Flowers Cycle** (`/writing-with-agents:flowers-cycle`) — The single-article inner loop that takes a topic through Madman, Whirlybird, Architect, Carpenter, Judge, and Quality Rubric phases.

2. **Content Strategy** (`/writing-with-agents:content-strategy`) — The multi-article outer loop that takes a research corpus through Intake, Gap Analysis, Domain Mapping, Content Plan, Production, and Knowledge Harvest.

The content strategy workflow invokes the flowers cycle for each article in the content plan.
