# Flowers Cycle Workflow

Orchestrates a single article through the complete Flowers writing cycle:

1. **Madman** — AI generates 3-5x raw material, human seeds with experience
2. **Whirlybird** — AI generates 2-3 mindmap options, human selects
3. **Architect** — Human decides structure, AI formulates blueprint
4. **Carpenter** — AI builds prose section by section, human spot-checks
5. **Judge** — AI runs 5 detection passes, human decides what to fix
6. **Quality Rubric** — AI scores 10 dimensions, routes rework if needed

Each phase has explicit handoff deliverables and human decision points.
